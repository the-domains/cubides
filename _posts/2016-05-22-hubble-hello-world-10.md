Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) image (full range of ultraviolet to near-infrared light) includes some of the most distant galaxies to have been imaged by an optical telescope, existing shortly after the Big Bang (June 2014). (This photo has the same field of view as the 2012 XDF, but NASA reverted to the older moniker of HUDF with the photo's release.) \[1\]
